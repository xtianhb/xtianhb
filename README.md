### Hi there, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cristian
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on IoT, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Electronics, and Software.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Machine Learning, Data Science, modern C++, and Deep Learning.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Data Science, Machine Learning, climate change, medicine, and sustentability.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Electronics, Software, Machine Learning, Embedded Systems, Computer Vision.
- âš¡ Fun fact: The avatar is the character Tintin from The Adventures of Tintin comic.

MeLi2019: A competition of Data Science and NLP for the ML market place. It was my first approach in the topic. Very fun. Of course I didn't win but went from zero to rank #50.
utn_tf: Code snippet on CoLab to train an object detector. It is part of a talk I gave at my University.
MeLi2020: Another editicion of the competition of Data Science and NLP for the market place.
hanoi: Someday I will have to finish it, I want to implement a graphical hanoi tower solution in C++.
xtianhb.github.io: Just a github profile page. Check at xtianhb.github.io
spark: A course I did about spark, pyspark, machine learning, and spark streaming.
sql: Codes from a SQL (postgreSQL) course for Data Science.
pvsim: A basic pv simulator for a system charging and discharging, in Python.
modern_cpp: A course to review modern C++. vscode and gnu Linux. Love the C++ complexity.

I can't share other projects, are private stuff, but if you like  if I could upload generic stuff related to machine learning, computer vision, and embedded systems.
